Udacity Front-End â€“ Classic Arcade Game Clone
=============================================

This is the classic frogger clone game. You are a player that is trying to cross to the river while trying to avoid collision with enemies (lady bugs). The enemies move unpredictably, so be careful! The player is allowed to move up, down, left and right and can even move back into the grassy area where no enemies will appear.

If a collision occurs, the player is automatically transported to the start point and has to start over.

If the player makes it to the river, an alert will appear congratulating the player's hard work. The game will automatically reset soon after and the player can play again.
